## What is this?
THis is an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

# How does it work?


# What is it using?


# Server-side Routing

* The following HTML routes created:

  * GET `/notes` - Should return the `notes.html` file.

  * GET `*` - Should return the `index.html` file

* The application has a `db.json` file on the backend that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

* The following API routes created:

  * GET `/api/notes` - Should read the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.

  * POST `/api/notes` - Should recieve a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client.

  * DELETE `/api/notes/:id` - Should recieve a query paramter containing the id of a note to delete. This means you'll need to find a way to give each note a unique `id` when it's saved. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the `db.json` file, remove the note with the given `id` property, and then rewrite the notes to the `db.json` file.
